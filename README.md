Dungeons and Dragons Mini Games or how i call it : E.I.M.G.a.S
which stands for - Extendet Interaction Mini Games and Stuff.

And firstly it supposed to just have mini games for different situation.
But now i will move toward setting it as companion, with dices, stats and more.

As a Master, i looked for ways to make our sessions better and more interactive than just throwing dices.

That is what i come up with.
